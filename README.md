# Facial Recognition System

This project is a facial recognition system developed using the PCA/Eigen analysis technique. The system is implemented in C++ using the Qt framework and provides a user-friendly graphical interface for face detection and recognition.

## Features

The facial recognition system includes the following features:

- Face detection using a built-in algorithm implemented in C++.
- Feature extraction using the PCA/Eigen analysis technique.
- Recognition of faces based on the Euclidean distance between the projected image and the eigenfaces of known faces.
- Robustness to variations in lighting conditions and facial expressions.
- Evaluation of system performance using the ROC curve.

## Technologies Used

The facial recognition system is implemented using the following technologies:

- C++ programming language for high performance and flexibility.
- Qt C++ framework for cross-platform graphical user interface development.
- Built-in face detection algorithm implemented in C++.
- PCA/Eigen analysis technique for feature extraction and recognition.

## Dataset

The facial recognition system was trained and tested on standard face datasets available at [http://www.face-rec.org/databases/](http://www.face-rec.org/databases/). These datasets contain thousands of face images with different poses, expressions, and lighting conditions.

## Installation

To install and run the facial recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the Qt framework and C++ compiler.
3. Build the project using Qt Creator or the command line.
4. Run the executable file to launch the facial recognition system.

## Usage

To use the facial recognition system, follow these steps:

1. Launch the executable file to open the graphical interface.
2. Click the "Detect Faces" button to detect faces in the input image.
3. Click the "Recognize Faces" button to recognize the detected faces.
4. View the results in the graphical interface or save them to a file.
